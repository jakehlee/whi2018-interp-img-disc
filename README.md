# Interpretable Discovery in Large Image Datasets

This repository contains supplemental scripts and data used in the experiments presented in the paper.

## Scripts

`gen_html.py` collects the results from DEMUD and Dosovitskiy and Brox inversions into a single HTML file for convenient viewing. It requires the following paths to be edited into the appropriate variables:
* `outputname` - The path of the html file to be generated
* `imageset_dir` - The directory containing the full imageset, but **not in subdirectories**
* `dosov_dir` - The directory containing the inversions generated by Dosovitskiy and Brox. It assumes the following subdirectories:
	* `dosov_dir/select/` - Inversions of the features in the `select-cnn-*.csv` output from DEMUD `-v`
	* `dosov_dir/recon/` - Inversions of the features in the `recon-cnn-*.csv` output from DEMUD `-v`
	* `dosov_dir/resid/` - Inversions of the features in the `resid-cnn-*.csv` output from DEMUD `-v`
* `demud_path` - The `selections-kn.csv` output file from DEMUD `-v`
* `perfplot_path` - The path to the discovery performance plot, if it was generated.

-----------

`plot/plot_exp.py` and `plot/utli_plot.py` were used to generate the plots shown in the paper. `plot_exp.py` requires the directory containing DEMUD result folders. Note that, since these scripts were used specifically for our set of experiments, they may not be easy to use for other experiments.

## Data

`sun-class/` includes an additional "sun" class to the Mars image dataset available on [Zenodo](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1049137). These 21 additional images were included for the experiments presented in the paper.
